This website is service for a homework coming from [p8105](https://p8105.com/making_websites.html),
but this is a great chance to setup my own website to introduce myself and fullfill my Github.
This would be really fun!

You can learn more about me through the page [resume](resume.html)

I also use [google](https://www.google.com/) a ton for the data.

In order to show my ability of using R, refer to [this page](plots.html) with full details.
